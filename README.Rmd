The goal of `usa` is to provide updated versions of the `state` data sets
included with R. When attached, this package **overwrites** these original
vectors. The vectors from this package contain information for the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the other sovereign territories of the United States
of America.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `usa` from [GitHub] with:

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/usa")
```

[GitHub]: https://github.com/kiernann/usa

## Base Data

R ships with seven outdated "state" objects:

* `state.abb`: character vector of 2-letter abbreviations for the state names.
* `state.area`: numeric vector of state areas (in square miles).
* `state.center`: list giving the approximate geographic center of each state.
* `state.division`: factor giving state geographic census divisions.
* `state.name`: character vector giving the full state names.
* `state.region`: factor giving the census region.
* `state.x77`: matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns:
  * `Population`: population estimate as of July 1, 1975
  * `Income`: per capita income (1974)
  * `Illiteracy`: illiteracy (1970, percent of population)
  * `Life Exp`: life expectancy in years (1969–71)
  * `Murder`: murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000 population (1976)
  * `HS Grad`: percent high-school graduates (1970)
  * `Frost`: mean number of days with minimum temperature below freezing (1931–1960)
  * `Area`: land area in square miles

```{r old}
base <- data.frame(
  abb = state.abb,
  name = state.name,
  region = state.region,
  division = state.division,
  center.x = state.center$x,
  center.y = state.center$y
)
head(base)
head(state.x77)
```

## New Data

This package contains new versions of these objects. Attaching the package
with `library()` will **overwrite** these vectors with newer, longer versions.
The new versions maintain the same class and content.

```{r join_states, message=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(usa)
setdiff(usa::state.abb, datasets::state.abb)
unique(usa::state.region)
unique(datasets::state.region)
```

The package also contains two [tibbles] identifying the states and
territories and providing various updated statistics.

```{r tibbles}
head(usa::states)
head(usa::info)
```
