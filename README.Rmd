The goal of 'usa' is to provide updated versions of the 'datasets' objects
included with R. When attached, this package **overwrites** these original
vectors with information on all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and
Puerto Rico. As of now, information on the other territories are provided in
separate objects.

## Installation

You can install the release version of 'usa' from [CRAN][cran] with:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usa")
```

Or the development version from [GitHub][gh] with:

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("k5cents/usa")
```

## Base Data

R ships with eight outdated objects in the 'datasets' package: 7 vectors and a
matrix of statistics from the 1970's.

```{r enframe_vectors, echo=FALSE}
base.vectors <- data.frame(
  name = state.name,
  abb = state.abb,
  region = state.region,
  division = state.division,
  area = state.area,
  center.x = state.center$x,
  center.y = state.center$y
)
```

```{r vectors}
head(base.vectors)
```

```{r state.x77}
head(state.x77)
```

## New Data

This package contains new, expanded versions of these vectors.

```{r join_states, message=FALSE}
setdiff(usa::state.abb, datasets::state.abb)
unique(usa::state.region)
show(usa::territory.abb)
```

The package contains [tibbles][tib] identifying the states and providing updated
facts and figures.

```{r states}
usa::states
```

```{r facts}
usa::facts
```

```{r territory}
usa::territory
```

ZIP codes from the archived ['zipcode'][zip] package are also included

```{r zipcodes}
usa::zipcodes
```

These synthetic survey respondents from [Pew][pew] provide a statistically
accurate sample of the American people.

```{r people}
dplyr::select(usa::people, 1:8)
```
