The goal of 'usa' is to provide updated versions of the 'state' data sets
included with R. When attached, this package **overwrites** these original
vectors. The new vectors contain information on all fifty states, the District
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. As of this version, information on the other
territories are provided in separate objects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of 'usa' from [GitHub][gh] with:

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/usa")
```

## Base Data

R ships with eight outdated objects in the 'datasets' package, 7 vectors and a
matrix of statistics.

```{r enframe_vectors, echo=FALSE}
base.vectors <- data.frame(
  name = state.name,
  abb = state.abb,
  region = state.region,
  division = state.division,
  area = state.area,
  center.x = state.center$x,
  center.y = state.center$y
)
```

```{r old}
head(base.vectors)
head(state.x77)
```

## New Data

This package contains new versions of these objects.

```{r join_states, message=FALSE}
setdiff(usa::state.abb, datasets::state.abb)
unique(usa::state.region)
show(usa::territory.abb)
```

The package also contains two [tibbles][tib] identifying the states and
and providing various updated facts and figures.

```{r tibbles}
usa::states
usa::facts
```

An additional tibble and vectors for just the territories.

```{r territory}
usa::territory
```

ZIP codes and counties are also included. ZIP codes are from the archived
[zipcodes][zip] package.

```{r zips}
usa::zipcodes
usa::counties
```

The `people` tibble contains 20,000 synthetic survey respondents created by the 
[Pew Research Center][pew]. Statistically accurate first and last names have
been added to improve authenticity.

```{r people}
dplyr::select(usa::people, 1:8)
```
